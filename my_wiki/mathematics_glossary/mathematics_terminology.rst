| asymptote
| Definition: a line that continually approaches a given curve but doesn’t meet it at any finite length.
| 
| vertex [顶点]
| Definition: Each angular point of a polygon, polyhedron, or other figure.
| Plural: vertices
| Synonyms: apex, peak, pinnacle
| 
| decimal
| Definition: (decimal fraction) a fraction whose denominator is a power of ten and whose numerator is expressed by figures placed to the right of a decimal point.
| Usage: The decimal 0.61 stands for 61 hundredths.
| 
| denominator [分母]
| Definition: (mathematics) the number below the line in a fraction showing how many parts the whole is divided into.
| Antonyms: numerator [分子]
| Usage: common denominator. [公分母]
| Least common multiple [最小公倍数]
| 
| mantissa
| Definition: (mathematics) the part of a logarithm after the decimal point.
| Definition: (computing) the part of a floating-point number which represents the significant digits of that number.
|
| quotient [商]
| Definition: In arithmetic, a quotient (from Latin: quotiens "how many times", pronounced /ˈkwoʊʃənt/) is the quantity produced by the division of two numbers. The quotient has widespread use throughout mathematics, and is commonly referred to as a fraction or a ratio. For example, when dividing twenty (the dividend) by three (the divisor), the quotient is six and two thirds. In this sense, a quotient is the ratio of a dividend to its divisor.

| power
| Definition: In mathematics, power is used in expressions such as 2 to the power of 4 or 2 to the 4th power to indicate that 2 must be multiplied by itself 4 times.
| Usage: Any number to the power of nought is equal to one.
| 
| cardinality
| Definition: the number of elements in a set or other grouping, as a property of that grouping.
| 
| cardinal, ordinal, nominal number
| A cardinal number says how many of something there are, such as one, two, three; [基数词]
| An ordinal number tells us the position of something in a list; [序数词]
| A nominal number is a number used only as a name, or to identify something (not as an actual value or position).

   Manhanttan Distance
   
   Red: Manhattan distance.
   Green: diagonal, straight-line distance. 
   Blue, yellow: equivalent Manhattan distances.

The distance between two points in a grid based on a strictly horizontal
and/or vertical path (that is, along the grid lines), as opposed to the diagonal
or "as the crow flies" distance. The Manhattan distance is the simple sum of the
horizontal and vertical components, whereas the diagonal distance might be
computed by applying the Pythagorean theorem. [勾股定理]

| orthognal
| Definition: of or involving right angles; at right angles. [正交]
| Definition: (statistics) of variates statistically independent. [相互独立]
| Definition: (of an experiment) having variates which can be treated as statistically independent.
| 
| asymptote
| asymptotic
| asymptotically
| Definition: a line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance.

| Cartesian
| Cartesianism
| Definition: relating to Descartes and his ideas.
| Definition: a follower of Descartes.
| Origin: mid 17th century: from modern Latin Cartesianus, from Cartesius, Latinized form of the name of Descartes.
| 
| normal
| Definition: [technical] a line at right angles to a given line or surface.
| Usage: unit normal. [单位法向量]
|
| extrapolate
| Definition: extend the application of (a method or conclusion, especially one based on statistics) 
| to an unknown situation by assuming that existing trends will continue or similar methods 
| will be applicable.
| Usage: the results cannot be extrapolated to other patient groups.
| Usage: it is always dangerous to extrapolate from a sample.
| Usage: attempts to extrapolate likely human cancers from laboratory studies.
| Definition: (mathematics) extend (a graph, curve, or range of values) by inferring unknown values 
| from trends in the known data.
| 
| interpolate
| Definition: insert (something of a different nature) into something else.
| Usage: illustrations were interpolated in the text.
| Definition: interject (a remark) in a conversation.
| Usage: “I dare say,” interpolated her employer.
| Definition: (mathematics) insert (an intermediate value or term) into a series 
| by estimating or calculating it from surrounding known values.
| 
| symmetric
| Definition: made up of exactly similar parts facing each other or around an axis; symmetrical.
| Usage: The structure is completely sysmetric.
