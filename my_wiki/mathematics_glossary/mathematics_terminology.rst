modulo [取余]

(in mathematics) with respect to or using a modulus of a specified number.
Two numbers are congruent modulo a given number if they give the same remainder
when divided by that number: 19 and 64 are congruent modulo 5.

multiplicative inverser

In mathematics, a **multiplicative inverse** or **reciprocal** for a number *x*,
denoted by :math:`\frac{1}{x}` or :math:`x^{−1}`, is a number which when multiplied
by x yields the multiplicative identity, 1. The multiplicative inverse of a fraction
:math:`\frac{a}{b}` is :math:`\frac{b}{a}`. For the multiplicative inverse of a real
number, divide 1 by the number. For example, the reciprocal of 5 is one fifth (1/5 or 0.2),
and the reciprocal of 0.25 is 4. The reciprocal function, the function *f(x)* that maps *x* 
to :math:`\frac{1}{x}`, is one of the simplest examples of a function which is its own inverse
(an involution).

   The reciprocal function: :math:`y = \frac{1}{x}`. For every x except 0, y represents its multiplicative inverse.

| vertex [顶点]
| Definition: Each angular point of a polygon, polyhedron, or other figure.
| Plural: vertices
| Synonyms: apex, peak, pinnacle
| 
| decimal
| Definition: (decimal fraction) a fraction whose denominator is a power of ten and whose numerator is expressed by figures placed to the right of a decimal point.
| Usage: The decimal 0.61 stands for 61 hundredths.
| 
| denominator
| Definition: (mathematics) the number below the line in a fraction showing how many parts the whole is divided into, for example in :math:`\frac{3}{4}`.
| Synonyms: numerator
| Usage: common denominator. [公分母]
| 
| 
| mantissa
| Definition: (MATHEMATICS) the part of a logarithm after the decimal point.
| Definition: (COMPUTING) the part of a floating-point number which represents the significant digits of that number.
| 
| Least common multiple 最小公倍数
|
| quotient 商
| Definition: In arithmetic, a quotient (from Latin: quotiens "how many times", pronounced /ˈkwoʊʃənt/) is the quantity produced by the division of two numbers. The quotient has widespread use throughout mathematics, and is commonly referred to as a fraction or a ratio. For example, when dividing twenty (the dividend) by three (the divisor), the quotient is six and two thirds. In this sense, a quotient is the ratio of a dividend to its divisor.

| power
| Definition: In mathematics, power is used in expressions such as 2 to the power of 4 or 2 to the 4th power to indicate that 2 must be multiplied by itself 4 times.
| Usage: Any number to the power of nought is equal to one.
| 
| cardinal, ordinal, nominal number
| A cardinal number says how many of something there are, such as one, two, three; [基数词]
| An ordinal number tells us the position of something in a list; [序数词]
| A nominal number is a number used only as a name, or to identify something (not as an actual value or position).

   Manhanttan Distance
   
   Red: Manhattan distance.
   Green: diagonal, straight-line distance. 
   Blue, yellow: equivalent Manhattan distances.

The distance between two points in a grid based on a strictly horizontal
and/or vertical path (that is, along the grid lines), as opposed to the diagonal
or "as the crow flies" distance. The Manhattan distance is the simple sum of the
horizontal and vertical components, whereas the diagonal distance might be
computed by applying the Pythagorean theorem. [勾股定理]

| asymptote
| asymptotic
| asymptotically
| Definition: a line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance.

**Additive inverse**
 
In mathematics, the additive inverse of a number *a* is the number that, 
when added to *a*, yields zero. This number is also known as the opposite (number), 
sign change, and negation. For a real number, it reverses its sign: the opposite to 
a positive number is negative, and the opposite to a negative number is positive.


An acute angle is less than :math:`90^\circ`.
An right angle is exactly :math:`90^\circ`.
An obtuse angle is between :math:`90^\circ` and :math:`180^\circ`.


**Homotopy**

A continuous transformation from one function to another. 
A homotopy between two functions **f** and **g** from a space **X** to a space **Y** 
is a continuous map **G** from :math:`X \times [0,1]| \mapsto Y` such that **G(x,0)=f(x)** 
and **G(x,1)=g(x)**, where :math:`\times` denotes set pairing. Another way of saying this 
is that a homotopy is a path in the mapping space **Map(X,Y)** from the first function to 
the second.

Two mathematical objects are said to be homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other. 
The concept of homotopy was first formulated by *Poincaré* around 1900.
