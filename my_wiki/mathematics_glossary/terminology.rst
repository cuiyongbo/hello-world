| multiplicative inverser
| Definition: In mathematics, a **multiplicative inverse** or **reciprocal** for a number x, denoted by :math:`\frac{1}{x}` or :math:`x^{−1}`, is a number which when multiplied by x yields the multiplicative identity, 1. The multiplicative inverse of a fraction :math:`\frac{a}{b}` is :math:`\frac{b}{a}`. For the multiplicative inverse of a real number, divide 1 by the number. For example, the reciprocal of 5 is one fifth (1/5 or 0.2), and the reciprocal of 0.25 is 4. The reciprocal function, the function f(x) that maps x to :math:`\frac{1}{x}`, is one of the simplest examples of a function which is its own inverse (an involution).

   The reciprocal function: :math:`y = \frac{1}{x}`. For every x except 0, y represents its multiplicative inverse.
