#. quotient [商]

    In arithmetic, a quotient is the quantity produced by the division of two numbers. 
    The quotient has widespread use throughout mathematics, and is commonly referred 
    to as a fraction or a ratio. For example, when dividing twenty (the **dividend**) 
    by three (the **divisor**), the quotient is six and two thirds. In this sense, 
    a quotient is the ratio of a dividend to its divisor.

#. Matrix Trace 

    In linear algebra, the trace of an n×n square matrix A is defined to 
    be **the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of A.** The trace of 
    a matrix is the sum of the eigenvalues [特征值], and it is invariant with 
    respect to a change of basis. This characterization can be used to 
    define the trace of a linear operator in general. **Note** that 
    the trace is only defined for a square matrix.

    .. math::

        \begin{vmatrix}
        \underline{a_{00}} & a_{01} & a_{02} \\
        a_{10} & \underline{a_{11}} & a_{12} \\
        a_{20} & a_{21} & \underline{a_{22}} \\
        \end{vmatrix}
