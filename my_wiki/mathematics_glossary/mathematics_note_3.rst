#. quotient [商]

    In arithmetic, a quotient is the quantity produced by the division of two numbers. 
    The quotient has widespread use throughout mathematics, and is commonly referred 
    to as a fraction or a ratio. For example, when dividing twenty (the **dividend**) 
    by three (the **divisor**), the quotient is six and two thirds. In this sense, 
    a quotient is the ratio of a dividend to its divisor.
