#. Sums of squares and cubes
   
   .. math::

      \sum_{k=0}^{n} {k^2} &= \frac {n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \\
      \sum_{k=0}^{n} {k^3} &= \frac {n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \\
      \sum_{k=0}^{n} {x^k} &= \frac {x^{n+1}-1}{x-1} \\
      \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {kx^k} &= \frac {x}{(1-x)^2} \text{ for } \lvert x \rvert < 1

#. Harmonic Series
   
   .. math:: 

      \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = \ln n + O(1)

#. Identity function
   
   In mathematics, an identity function, also called an identity relation 
   or identity transformation, is a function that always returns the same 
   value that was used as its argument. In equations, the function is 
   given by :math:`f(x) = x`.

#. Idempotence
   
   In mathematics, a number that is idempotent keeps the same value when multiplied by itself, 
   no matter how many times the function is applied. The word idempotent comes from the Latin 
   words idem, which means "the same," and potent, from potentem, which means "power."
