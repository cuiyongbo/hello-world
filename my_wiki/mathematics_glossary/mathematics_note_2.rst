#. Sums of squares and cubes
   
   .. math::

      \sum_{k=0}^{n} {k^2} &= \frac {n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \\
      \sum_{k=0}^{n} {k^3} &= \frac {n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \\
      \sum_{k=0}^{n} {x^k} &= \frac {x^{n+1}-1}{x-1} \\
      \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {kx^k} &= \frac {x}{(1-x)^2} \text{ for } \lvert x \rvert < 1

#. Harmonic Series
   
   .. math:: 

      \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = \ln n + O(1)

#. Identity function
   
   In mathematics, an identity function, also called an identity relation 
   or identity transformation, is a function that always returns the same 
   value that was used as its argument. In equations, the function is 
   given by :math:`f(x) = x`.

#. Idempotence
   
   In mathematics, a number that is idempotent keeps the same value when multiplied by itself, 
   no matter how many times the function is applied. The word idempotent comes from the Latin 
   words idem, which means "the same," and potent, from potentem, which means "power."

#. Radix point
   
   In mathematics and computing, a radix point is the symbol used in numerical representations 
   to separate the integer part of a number from its fractional part. "Radix point" applies to 
   all number bases. In base 10 notation, the radix point is more commonly called the **decimal point,** 
   Similarly, the term **binary point** is used for base 2.

   
#. Tensor
   
   a mathematical object analogous to but more general than a vector, 
   represented by an array of components that are functions of the 
   coordinates of a space.
