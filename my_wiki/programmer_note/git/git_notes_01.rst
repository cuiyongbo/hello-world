#. Create a new repository

   Start a repository from blank::

      $ cd projectDir
      $ git init

      git init projecName

   .. note::

      git will create a directory named *projecName*


#. Remove project from git version control

   Remove :file:`.git` directory from your projects, you may
   have multi such folders. so try this command::
      
      $ cd git-project
      $ find . -type d -path "*.git" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf
   
   In addition to the steps above, you may want to also remove
   the :file:`.gitignore` file(s). Consider removing the :file:`.gitignore`
   file(s) if you want to remove any trace of Git in your project.
   Consider keeping the :file:`.gitignore` file(s) if you would ever
   want reincorporate Git into the project::
   
      $ find . -type f -name ".gitignore" -delete


#. Git to checkout a new branch and track itself

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ git checkout -b brach_name
      # perform changing and commit changes
      $ git push -u origin branch_name
      $ git push -u origin local_branch:remote_branch # remote_branch may be not existing.

      # second solution
      $ git branch enroute_ti_server_add_traffic_event origin/enroute_ti_server_add_traffic_event
      Branch enroute_ti_server_add_traffic_event set up to track remote branch enroute_ti_server_add_traffic_event from origin.


#. Create a new local branch

   .. code-block:: sh

      git checkout -B branch_name remotes/origin/branch_name --
      git checkout -B branch_name origin/branch_name
      git checkout -b branch_name # branch_name doesn't exist.

   .. code-block:: none
      :caption: Manual

      git checkout -b|-B <new_branch> [<start point>]
      
      Specifying -b causes a new branch to be created as if git-branch(1) were called 
      and then checked out. In this case you can use the --track or --no-track options, 
      which will be passed to git branch. As a convenience, --track without -b implies 
      branch creation; see the description of --track below. 

      If -B is given, <new_branch> is created if it doesnâ€™t exist; otherwise, it is reset. 
      This is the transactional equivalent of

         $ git branch -f <branch> [<start point>]
         $ git checkout <branch>

      that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless "git checkout" is successful.


#. Find the information about branchs

   .. code-block:: sh
   
      git branch # show local branches
        master
      * test # current branch
      git branch -r # show remote branches
        origin/HEAD -> origin/master # where current local branch points to 
        origin/master
        origin/test
      git branch -a # both local and remote branch
      * master
        remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
        remotes/origin/master
      git branch -v
        master b351f2e [ahead 1] Added git to delete a remote branch
      * test   40eebf1 Reviewed git note
      git branch -vv # attach upstream branch
        master b351f2e [origin/master: ahead 1] Added git to delete a remote branch
      * test   40eebf1 [origin/test] Reviewed git note
      

#. Rename a local branch

   If you want to rename a branch while pointed to any branch, do:
   
   .. code-block:: sh
   
      git branch -m <oldname> <newname>
   
   If you want to rename the current branch, you can do:
   
   .. code-block:: sh
   
      git branch -m <newname>
   
   A way to remember this, is ``-m`` is for "move" (or mv), which is how you rename files.


#. Delete a local branch

   .. code-block:: sh
   
      git branch -D <branch_name>


#. Delete a remote branch

   .. code-block:: sh
   
      git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
   
   .. note::
   
      Mostly the <remote_name> is ``origin``. no need to switch to remote_name/branch_name


#. Rename a remote branch

   .. code-block:: sh
   
      git checkout -b test1 # swith to a test branch, create test branch if it doesn't exist
      git push --set-upstream origin test1 # push the current branch and set the remote as upstream
      git branch -m test # rename branch name to the desired one
      git push origin :test1 # delete the old-name remote branch
      git push --set-upstream origin test # reset the upstream branch for the new branch


#. Commit skip add

   By using the ``-a`` switch with the commit command to automatically "add" changes from
   all known files (i.e. all files that are already listed in the index) and
   to automatically "rm" files in the index that have been removed from the working tree,
   and then perform the actual commit. 
   
   .. code-block:: sh
   
      $ git commit -a -m "added git commit: -a, --amend options"
      $ git status
      On branch master
      Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
        (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
      Untracked files:
        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
      
              programmer_note/number_tricks.rst # untracking files still unstaged, thus, uncommitted. 
      
      nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


#. Commit with amendment

   .. code-block:: sh
   
      $ git log -2 --oneline
      8b8ce2f added number tricks
      6cbd05f added git commit: -a, --amend options
      
      $ git commit -a --amend
   
      $ git log -2 --oneline
      edb911d added number tricks # note that the commit ID has changed
      6cbd05f added git commit: -a, --amend options
   
      $ git log -2 --oneline
      8710e3c implemented git commit --amend
      edb911d added number tricks
      
      $ git commit -a --amend -m"implemented git commit --amend, and fix"
      
      $ git log -2 --oneline
      2ee7aee implemented git commit --amend, and fix
      edb911d added number tricks

   .. note::

      Important: If you've already pushed commits to remote server, and then squash them locally,
      you will have to force the push to your branch.

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ git push origin branch-name --force
         $ git push --force-with-lease --progress "origin" master:master


#. Stash current changes

   .. code-block:: sh
      :caption: git stash usage 
   
      $ git stash help
      usage: git stash list [<options>]
         or: git stash show [<stash>]
         or: git stash drop [-q|--quiet] [<stash>]
         or: git stash ( pop | apply ) [--index] [-q|--quiet] [<stash>]
         or: git stash branch <branchname> [<stash>]
         or: git stash [save [--patch] [-k|--[no-]keep-index] [-q|--quiet]
                             [-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [<message>]]
         or: git stash clear
      
   .. code-block:: sh

      $ git stash save -- combine_commits
      Saved working directory and index state On test: combine_commits
      HEAD is now at cd1e124 commit another 3 commits
      
      $ git stash list
      stash@{0}: On test: combine_commits
      
      $ git stash drop stash@{0} # delete a stash
      Dropped stash@{0} (243d8bf957027713d5bc89be8b66c214e9e7abf9)
      
      $ git stash pop # restore changes

#. Discard unstaged changes in working directory

   .. code-block:: sh
   
      git checkout -- <file>...


#. Git customization

   warning: *push.default* is unset; its implicit value is changing in
   Git 2.0 from ``'matching'`` to ``'simple'``. To squelch this message
   and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use::
   
     git config --global push.default matching
   
   To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use::
   
     git config --global push.default simple
   
   When *push.default* is set to ``'matching'``, git will push local branches
   to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.
   
   In Git 2.0, Git will default to the more conservative ``'simple'``
   behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
   remote branch that ``'git pull'`` uses to update the current branch.
   
   See ``'git help config'`` and search for ``'push.default'`` for further
   information. (the ``'simple'`` mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the
   similar mode ``'current'`` instead of ``'simple'`` if you sometimes use
   older versions of Git).

   Add following configure to global :file:`.gitconfig`::
      
      [remote "origin"]
      prune = true

   to remove remote branch(es) that have been deleted.  


#. Git to abort git pull

   .. code-block:: sh
      
         git reset --keep HEAD@{1}
         # or
         git reset --hard HEAD^1

   .. note:: 

      Note that any local changes will be discarded.


#. Git force pull

   .. note:: 
   
      If you have any local changes, they will be lost.
      With or without ``--hard`` option, any local commits
      that haven't been pushed will be lost. If you have any
      files that are not tracked by Git (e.g. uploaded user
      content), these files will not be affected.
   
   Basically::
   
      git fetch --all
   
   Then, you have two options::
   
      git reset --hard origin/master
   
   OR If you are on some other branch::
   
      git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>
   
   Explanation:
   
   ``git fetch`` downloads the latest from remote without trying to
   merge or rebase anything. Then the ``git reset`` resets the ``master``
   branch to what you just fetched. The ``--hard`` option changes all the files
   in your working tree to match the files in ``origin/master``.
   
   and you can maintain current local commits by creating a branch from master
   before resetting::
   
      git checkout master
      git branch new-branch-to-save-current-commits
      git fetch --all
      git reset --hard origin/master
   
   After this, all of the old commits will be kept in ``new-branch-to-save-current-commits``.
   Uncommitted changes however (even staged), will be lost. Make sure to stash and commit anything you need.


#. Change remote url

   .. code-block:: sh

      git remote get-url [--push] [--all] <name>
   
   Retrieves the URLs for a remote. Configurations for insteadOf and pushInsteadOf
   are expanded here. By default, only the first fetch URL is listed.
   
   * With ``--push``, push URLs are queried rather than fetch URLs.
   * With ``--all``, all URLs for the remote will be listed. [only FETCH url]
   
   .. code-block:: sh
   
      git remote set-url [--push] <name> <newurl> [<oldurl>]
      git remote set-url --add <name> <newurl>
      git remote set-url --delete <name> <url>
   
   Changes URLs for the remote. Sets first URL for remote *name* (mostly, *name* is ``origin``) that
   matches regex *oldurl* (first URL if no *oldurl* is given) to  *newurl*. If *oldurl* doesnâ€™t match
   any URL, an error occurs and nothing is changed.
   
   * With ``--push``, push URLs are manipulated instead of fetch URLs.
   * With ``--add``, instead of changing existing URLs, new URL is added.
   * With ``--delete``, instead of changing existing URLs, all URLs matching regex *url* are deleted
      for remote *name*. Trying to delete all non-push URLs is an error.
   
   .. note::
   
      Note that the push URL and the fetch URL, even though they can be set differently,
      must still refer to the same place. What you pushed to the push URL should be what
      you would see if you immediately fetched from the fetch URL. If you are trying to
      fetch from one place (e.g. your upstream) and push to another (e.g. your publishing
      repository), use two separate remotes.

   .. code-block:: sh

      git remote set-url origin https://github.com/akheron/jansson.git


#. Cherry-pick one commit

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ git cherry-pick <commit-id>


#. Diff two different files

   .. code-block:: sh

      # First
      $ git diff --no-index fileA  fileB

      # Second
      $ diff fileA fileB

      # Third, colorfully diff, side by side comparison.
      $ vimdiff fileA fileB


#. Comparing with arbitrary commits

   .. code-block:: sh

      # Instead of using the tip of the current branch, compare with the tip of "test" branch
      git diff test
   
      # Compare with the tip of the current branch, but limit the comparison to the file "test"
      git diff HEAD -- ./test
   
      # Compare the version before the last commit and the last commit
      git diff HEAD^ HEAD
   
      # Changes between the tips of the <topic> and the <master> branches
      git diff topic master
   
      # Changes that occurred on the master branch since when the topic branch was started off it
      git diff topic...master


#. Merge branch

   .. code-block:: sh

      # Merge current branch with <branch>
      git merge <branch>


#. Remove files and keep local

   .. code-block:: sh
      
      $ git rm
      usage: git rm [<options>] [--] <file>...
   
       -n, --dry-run         dry run
       -q, --quiet           do not list removed files
       --cached              only remove from the index
       -f, --force           override the up-to-date check
       -r                    allow recursive removal
       --ignore-unmatch      exit with a zero status even if nothing matched

      git rm --cached -r file/directory

   afterwards add file/directory to *.gitignore* so git doesn't add it back.

   .. note::

      gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

      The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files 
      not tracked by Git remain untracked.

      To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, 
      use **git rm --cached**.

   One Example::

      $ git status
      [...]
      # Untracked files:
      [...]
      #       Documentation/foo.html
      #       Documentation/gitignore.html
      #       file.o
      #       lib.a
      #       src/internal.o
      [...]
      $ cat .git/info/exclude
      # ignore objects and archives, anywhere in the tree.
      *.[oa]
      $ cat Documentation/.gitignore
      # ignore generated html files,
      *.html
      # except foo.html which is maintained by hand
      !foo.html
      $ git status
      [...]
      # Untracked files:
      [...]
      #       Documentation/foo.html
      [...]

   Another example::

      $ cat .gitignore
      vmlinux*
      $ ls arch/foo/kernel/vm*
      arch/foo/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
      $ echo '!/vmlinux*' >arch/foo/kernel/.gitignore

   The second *.gitignore* prevents Git from ignoring *arch/foo/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S*.

   Example to exclude everything except a specific directory *foo/bar* (note the ``/*`` - without 
   the slash, the wildcard would also exclude everything within *foo/bar*)::

      $ cat .gitignore
      # exclude everything except directory foo/bar
      /*
      !/foo
      /foo/*
      !/foo/bar
