**SYNOPSIS**

   .. code-block:: c

      #include <stdio.h>

      int scanf(const char *format, ...);
      int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
      int sscanf(const char *str, const char *format, ...);

**DESCRIPTION**

   The ``scanf()`` family of functions scans input according to *format* as described below. This
   format may contain conversion specifications; the results from such conversions, if any,
   are stored in the locations pointed to by the pointer arguments that follow *format*. Each
   pointer argument must be of a type that is appropriate for the value returned by the
   corresponding conversion specification.

   If the number of conversion specifications in *format* exceeds the number of pointer arguments,
   the results are undefined. If the number of pointer arguments exceeds the number of conversion
   specifications, then the excess pointer arguments are evaluated, but are otherwise ignored.

   The ``scanf()`` function reads input from ``stdin``, ``fscanf()`` reads input from the stream
   pointer *stream*, and ``sscanf()`` reads its input from the character string pointed to by *str*.

   The *format* string consists of a sequence of directives which describe how to process the
   sequence of input characters. If processing of a directive fails, no further input is
   read, and ``scanf()`` returns. A "failure" can be either of the following: input failure,
   meaning that input characters were unavailable, or matching failure, meaning that the
   input was inappropriate.

   A directive is one of the following:

      * A sequence of white-space characters (space, tab, newline, etc.).
        This directive matches any amount of white space, including none, in the input.

      * An ordinary character (i.e., one other than white space or '%').
        This character must exactly match the next character of input.

      * A conversion specification, which commences with a ``%`` character. 
        A sequence of characters from the input is converted according to this specification,
        and the result is placed in the corresponding pointer argument. If the next item of
        input does not match the conversion specification, the conversion failsâ€”this is a
        matching failure.

   Each conversion specification in format begins with either the character ``%`` or the 
   character sequence ``%n$`` followed by:

      * An optional ``*`` assignment-suppression character: ``scanf()`` reads input as
        directed by the conversion specification, but discards the input. No corresponding 
        pointer argument is required, and this specification is not included in the count
        of successful assignments returned by ``scanf()``.

      * An optional ``m`` character.  This is used with string conversions (``%s, %c, %[``),
        and relieves the caller of the need to allocate a corresponding buffer to hold the 
        input: instead, ``scanf()`` allocates a buffer of sufficient size, and assigns the 
        address of this buffer to the corresponding pointer argument, which should be a 
        pointer to a ``char*`` variable (this variable does not need to be initialized before
        the call). **The caller should subsequently free(3) this buffer when it is no longer required.**

      * An optional decimal integer which specifies the maximum **field width**. Reading of 
        characters stops either when this maximum is reached or when a nonmatching character
        is found, whichever happens first. Most conversions discard initial whitespace
        characters, and these discarded characters don't count toward the maximum field width.  
        String input conversions store a terminating null byte ('\0') to mark the end of the 
        input; the maximum field width does not include this terminator.

      * An optional type modifier character. For example, the ``l`` type modifier is used
        with integer conversions  such as ``%ld`` to specify that the corresponding pointer
        argument refers to a long int rather than a pointer to an int.

      * A conversion specifier that specifies the type of input conversion to be performed.

   The conversion specifications in format are of two forms, either beginning with ``'%'`` or
   beginning with ``"%n$"``. The two forms should not be mixed in the same format string, except
   that a string containing ``"%n$"`` specifications can include ``%%`` and ``%*``. If format contains
   ``'%'`` specifications, then these correspond in order with successive pointer arguments. In
   the ``"%n$"`` form (which is specified in POSIX.1-2001, but not C99), n is a decimal integer
   that specifies that the converted input should be placed in the location referred to by
   the n-th pointer argument following format.

   The following **type modifier characters** can appear in a conversion specification::

      h     Indicates that the conversion will be one of d, i, o, u, x, X, or n and the next
            pointer is a pointer to a short int or unsigned short int (rather than int).

      hh    As for h, but the next pointer is a pointer to a signed char or unsigned char.

      j     As for h, but the next pointer is a pointer to an intmax_t or a uintmax_t. This
            modifier was introduced in C99.

      l     Indicates either that the conversion will be one of d, i, o, u, x, X, or n and the
            next  pointer is a pointer to a long int or unsigned long int (rather than int), or
            that the conversion will be one of e, f, or g and the next pointer is a pointer to
            double (rather than float).  Specifying two l characters is equivalent to L. If
            used with %c or %s, the corresponding parameter is considered as a pointer to a
            wide character or wide-character string respectively.

      L     Indicates that the conversion will be either e, f, or g and the next pointer is a
            pointer to long double or the conversion will be d, i, o, u,  or  x  and  the  next
            pointer is a pointer to long long.

      t     As for h, but the next pointer is a pointer to a ptrdiff_t.
            This modifier was introduced in C99.

      z     As for h, but the next pointer is a pointer to a size_t.
            This modifier was  introduced in C99.

   The following conversion specifiers are available::

      %     Matches a literal '%'. That is, %% in the format string matches a single input '%'
            character. No conversion is done (but initial white space characters are discarded),
            and assignment does not occur.

      d     Matches an optionally signed decimal integer; the next pointer must be a pointer to int.

      i     Matches an optionally signed integer; the next pointer must be a pointer to int.
            The integer is read in base 16 if it begins with 0x or 0X, in base 8 if it begins
            with 0, and in base 10 otherwise. Only characters that correspond to the base are used.

      o     Matches an unsigned octal integer; the next pointer must be a pointer to unsigned int.

      u     Matches an unsigned decimal integer; the next pointer must be a pointer to unsigned int.

      x     Matches an unsigned hexadecimal integer;  the next pointer must be a pointer to unsigned int.

      X     Equivalent to x.

      f     Matches an optionally signed floating-point number; the next pointer must be a pointer to float.

      e     Equivalent to f.

      g     Equivalent to f.

      E     Equivalent to f.

      s     Matches a sequence of non-white-space characters; the next pointer must be a
            pointer to the initial element of a character array that is long enough to hold the
            input sequence and the terminating null byte ('\0'), which is added automatically.
            The input string stops at white space or at the maximum field width, whichever
            occurs first.

      c     Matches a sequence of characters whose length is specified by the maximum field
            width (default 1); the next pointer must be a pointer to char, and there must be
            enough room for all the characters (no terminating null byte is added). The usual
            skip of leading white space is suppressed. To skip white space first,
            use an explicit space in the format.

      [     Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from the specified set of accepted
            characters; the next pointer must be a pointer to char, and there must be enough room
            for all the characters in the string, plus a terminating null byte. The usual skip
            of leading white space is suppressed. The string is to be made up of characters in
            (or not in) a particular set; the set is defined by the characters between the open
            bracket [ character and a close bracket ] character. The set excludes those
            characters if the first character after the open bracket is a circumflex (^). To
            include a close bracket in the set, make it the first character after the open
            bracket or the circumflex; any other position will end the set. The hyphen character
            - is also special; when placed between two other characters, it adds all intervening
            characters to the set. To include a hyphen, make it the last character
            before the final close bracket. For instance, [^]0-9-] means the  set  "everything
            except close bracket, zero through nine, and hyphen". The string ends with the
            appearance of a character not in the (or, with a circumflex, in) set or when the
            field width runs out.

      p     Matches a pointer value (as printed by %p in printf(3); the next pointer must be a
            pointer to a pointer to void.

      n     Nothing is expected; instead, the number of characters consumed thus far from the
            input is stored through the next pointer, which must be a pointer to int. This is
            not a conversion and does not increase the count returned by the function. The
            assignment can be suppressed with the * assignment-suppression character, but the
            effect on the return value is undefined. Therefore %*n conversions should not be
            used.


**RETURN VALUE**

   On success, these functions return the number of input items successfully matched and
   assigned; this can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in the event of an early
   matching failure.

   The value ``EOF`` is returned if the end of input is reached before either the first successful
   conversion or a matching failure occurs. ``EOF`` is also returned if a read error occurs,
   in which case the error indicator for the stream (see :manpage:`ferror(3)`) is set,
   and *errno* is set to indicate the error.


**EXAMPLE**

   To use the dynamic allocation conversion specifier, specify *m* as a length modifier (thus
   ``%ms`` or ``%m[range]``). The caller must :manpage:`free(3)` the returned string,
   as in the following example::

      char *p;
      int n;
      errno = 0;
      n = scanf("%m[a-z]", &p);
      if (n == 1) {
          printf("read: %s\n", p);
          free(p);
      } else if (errno != 0) {
          perror("scanf");
      } else {
          fprintf(stderr, "No matching characters\n");
      }

   As shown in the above example, it is necessary to call :manpage:`free(3)` 
   only if the ``scanf()`` call successfully read a string.
