   Steve Jobs (1955 - 2011)

Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being.
Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor.
Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.
