Pseudocode
**********

Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle 
of a computer program or other algorithm.

It uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is 
intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudocode typically 
omits details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, 
such as variable declarations, system-specific code and some subroutines. 
The programming language is augmented with natural language description details, 
where convenient, or with compact mathematical notation. **The purpose of using 
pseudocode is that it is easier for people to understand than conventional 
programming language code,** and that it is an efficient and **environment-independent** 
description of the key principles of an algorithm. It is commonly used in textbooks 
and scientific publications that are documenting various algorithms, and also in planning 
of computer program development, for sketching out the structure of the program 
before the actual coding takes place.

**No standard for pseudocode syntax exists,** as a program in pseudocode is not an executable program. 
Pseudocode resembles, but should not be confused with, skeleton programs which can be compiled without 
errors. Flowcharts, drakon-charts and :abbr:`UML (Unified Modeling Language)` charts can be thought of 
as a graphical alternative to pseudocode, but are more spacious on paper.

Typicallly, a programmer who needs to implement a specific algorithm, 
especially an unfamiliar one, will often start with a pseudocode description, 
and then "translate" that description into the target programming language 
and modify it to interact correctly with the rest of the program. 
Programmers may also start a project by sketching out the code in pseudocode 
on paper before writing it in its actual language, as a **top-down** structuring 
approach, with a process of steps to be followed as a refinement.

As the name suggests, **pseudocode generally does not actually obey the syntax rules 
of any particular language;** there is no systematic standard form, although any 
particular writer will generally borrow style and syntax; for example, 
control structures from some conventional programming language. 
Popular syntax sources include Fortran, Pascal, BASIC, C, C++, Java, Lisp, and ALGOL. 
Variable declarations are typically omitted. Function calls and blocks of code, 
such as code contained within a loop, are often replaced by a one-line natural language sentence.

Depending on the writer, pseudocode may therefore vary widely in style, from a near-exact imitation 
of a real programming language at one extreme, to a description approaching formatted prose at the other.
