#. which - locate a command

    .. code-block:: sh

        # which returns the pathnames of the files (or links) which would be executed in the current environment, 
        # had its arguments been given as commands in a strictly POSIX-conformant shell. It does this by searching 
        # the PATH for executable files matching the names of the arguments. It does not follow symbolic links.
        $ which cc

#. size

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ size -h
        Usage: size [option(s)] [file(s)]
         Displays the sizes of sections inside binary files
         If no input file(s) are specified, a.out is assumed
         The options are:
          -A|-B     --format={sysv|berkeley}  Select output style (default is berkeley)
          -o|-d|-x  --radix={8|10|16}         Display numbers in octal, decimal or hex
          -t        --totals                  Display the total sizes (Berkeley only)
                    --common                  Display total size for *COM* syms
                    --target=<bfdname>        Set the binary file format
                    @<file>                   Read options from <file>
          -h        --help                    Display this information
