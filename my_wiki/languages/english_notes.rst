Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as runaway leaders Barcelona equalled the La Liga record
of 38 games unbeaten with victory over Leganes.

Barcelona v Chelsea: Lionel Messi joins the Champions League 100 club.[百球俱乐部]

Some of Messi's close control and dribbling was breathtaking, drawing gasps of delight from the home crowd,
and with three goals and that wondrous assist over the course of the two legs of the Chelsea tie it's very easy
to conclude he was the difference between the teams.

Messi is an arch-competitor and is gunning for his fifth league title after seeing bitter rivals Real Madrid take
the crown for the past two seasons.

Though Messi will rightly claim the lion's share of the headlines, perhaps the most significant moment in the game
from the home team's perspective was Dembele's thumping finish from Messi's assist - his first goal in Barca colors.

His selection in the starting XI was a surprise after he was left on the bench for the first leg, but the flamboyant
manner in which he took his goal, firing a fierce rising drive into the root of the net, showed exactly how important he could 
become to the team.

Germany and Spain played out an entertaining friendly draw in a meeting
of the past two world champions.

Spain, the 2010 World Cup winners, led within six minutes as Rodrigo
smashed home from Andres Iniesta's pass.

But reigning world champions Germany levelled from Thomas Muller's
25-yard curling effort in a lively first half.

Elsewhere, France threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 to Colombia at
the Stade de France. [法兰西大球场]

Barcelona completed one of the greatest comebacks in football history
as Paris Saint-Germain choked an incredible night at Camp Nou . [诺坎普]

with his controlled and sensible passing keepping his team ticking over in the way Busquets has done for so many years.

Luis Suarez's header set Barca on their way before Philippe Coutinho's sublime backheel doubled the lead. [脚后跟妙传]

The original Lisa computer, named after Jobs' eldest daughter,
came out in 1983 and was generally considered to be a flop.
It was a hard device for consumers to embrace because, at the time,
it cost approximately $10,000. However, its operating system laid the
foundation for the macOS we're familiar with today.

Even the name “Lisa” comes with a lot of historic baggage. At the time,
Apple said the name was an acronym for Local Integrated System Architecture.
However, many suspected the name was a reference to Jobs’ first daughter Lisa
Nicole Brennan, who he denied fathering for years. In his later years, Jobs
admitted the computer was named after his daughter.
