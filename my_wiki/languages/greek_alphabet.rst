Greek alphabet
**************

The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language 
since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC. It was 
derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first 
alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as 
consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. 
Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient 
and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source 
of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science 
and other fields.

In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered 
from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only 
a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction 
between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during 
the modern era.

Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ 
between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage, because the pronunciation of 
Greek has changed significantly between the 5th century BC and today. 
Modern and Ancient Greek use different diacritics. The traditional orthography, 
which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek, has many diacritics, 
such as accent marks for pitch accent ("polytonic"), the breathing marks for the 
presence and absence of the initial /h/ sound, and the iota subscript for the final 
historical /i/ sound. In standard Modern Greek spelling, orthography has been 
simplified to a monotonic system, which uses only two diacritics: the acute 
accent and diaeresis.
