#. Ittekimasu 「いってきます」　vs　Itterasshai　「いってらしゃい」
   
    Ittekimasu means “I’m leaving.” it is actually made up of two parts, itte (I’m going) and kimasu (I will come). 
    Therefore, a more full translation might be “I’m leaving, and I will come back.” A more casual way to say 
    is ittekuru (いってくる).

    Itterasshai means “Have a safe trip.” which literally means, “Go and come back.” The nuance 
    is that they will come home safely, hence “have a safe trip” is the best English translation.

    Ittekimasu and Itterasshai are most often used with family members or people you live with. 
    It doesn’t matter which one is said first, but both expressions are usually exchanged 
    when someone leaves the house.

＃. itadakimasu (いただきます)

    .. image:: images/itadakimasu.jpg

    いただく (Itadaku) is a phrase that is very polite with the meaning “to take.”

    Traditionally itadakimasu is used when taking something from someone with higher 
    authority or position than oneself.

    Itadaku comes from one of the three types of 敬語 (keigo, “polite language”). 
    Specifically, this is 謙譲語 (kenjougo), “the humble form,” which is used to 
    figuratively lower oneself.

    The origins of this are based on Buddhism and the belief that everything 
    has a spirit that guides it. By taking spirits from their origins and 
    using them to replenish yourself, you are giving honor and gratitude 
    to the organisms that originally housed those spirits.

    It is very disrespectful to eat someone else’s meal without properly 
    giving thanks to them for making such food. Even if you made the meal 
    yourself, you are still giving respect to the lives used in its creation.

#. Gochisousama (御馳走様)
   
    * Gochisousama (Thanks for the Meal!) 
    * Okawari (Second Please!)
      
    By saying that, you show your appreciation again 
    to the person who serves, cooks, or provides the food.
