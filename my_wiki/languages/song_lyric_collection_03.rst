   :caption: Carpenters - Yesterday Once More

   When I was young
   I'd listen to the radio
   waiting for my favorite songs when they played I'd sing along
   It made me smile
   Those were such happy times
   And not so long ago
   How I wondered where they'd gone
   But they're back again
   Just like a long lost friend
   All the songs I loved so well
   Every sha la la la
   Every wo o wo o
   Still shines
   Every shing a ling a ling
   That they're starting to sing
   So fine
   When they get to the part
   Where he's breaking her heart
   It can really make me cry
   Just like before
   It's yesterday once more
   Shoobie do lang lang
   Shoobie do lang lang
   Looking back on how it was
   In years gone by
   And the good times that I had
   Makes today seem rather sad
   So much has changed
   It was songs of love that
   I would sing to them
   And I'd memorize each word
   Those old melodies
   Still sound so good to me
   As they melt the years away
   Every sha la la la
   Every wo o wo o
   Still shines
   Every shing a ling a ling
   That they're startin' to sing
   So fine
   All my best memories
   Come back clearly to me
   Some can even make me cry
   Just like before
   It's yesterday once more
   Shoobie do lang lang
   Every sha la la la
   Every wo o wo o
   Still shines
   Every shing a ling a ling
   That they're starting to sing
   So fine
   Every sha la la la
   Every wo o wo o
   Still shines
   Every shing a ling a ling
   That they're starting to sing
   So fine
