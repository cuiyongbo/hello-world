   Ripple effect

   A ripple effect is a situation in which, like ripples expanding across the water 
   when an object is dropped into it, an effect from an initial state can be followed 
   outwards incrementally.
   
   Ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier (economics).
   
   In sociology, it can be observed how social interactions can affect situations 
   not directly related to the initial interaction, and in charitable activities 
   where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community 
   to broaden its impact.
   
   The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software 
   metrics as a complexity measure.
