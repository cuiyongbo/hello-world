    National Robotic Week

#. :abbr:`MWC (Mobile World Congress)`: Why do smartphones look so alike?

    The reaction from many rivals, including Huawei, HTC, and LG, appears to have been to 
    hold off their own flagship [旗舰机] launches until later in the year. 
    
    But the world changed in 2007 when Steven Jobs pulled the IPhone out of his pocket, 
    and had what became the dominant design. We’ve since gravitated to the black rectangle 
    with a touchscreen as the form factor of choice, and it feels like we’ve now reached a 
    technology plateau where firms compete by offering marginal changes around the edges.

#. Ripple effect
   
    A ripple effect is a situation in which, like ripples expanding across the water 
    when an object is dropped into it, an effect from an initial state can be followed 
    outwards incrementally.
   
    Ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier (economics).
   
    In sociology, it can be observed how social interactions can affect situations 
    not directly related to the initial interaction, and in charitable activities 
    where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community 
    to broaden its impact.
   
    The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software 
    metrics as a complexity measure.
