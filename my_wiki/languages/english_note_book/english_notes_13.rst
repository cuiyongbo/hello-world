#. Astronomy [天文学]

    The branch of science that deals with celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole.

    In ancient times, observation of the sun, moon, stars, and planets formed the basis of timekeeping
    and navigation. Astronomy was greatly furthered by the invention of the optical telescope, but modern
    observations are made in all parts of the spectrum, including X-ray and radio frequencies, using
    terrestrial and orbiting instruments and space probes.

#. Big Bang

    A fireball of radiation at extremely high temperature and density, but occupying a tiny volume,
    is believed to have formed around 13.7 billion years ago. This expanded and cooled, extremely
    fast at first, but more slowly as subatomic particles condensed into matter that later
    accumulated to form galaxies and stars. The galaxies are currently still retreating from one another.
    What was left of the original radiation continued to cool and has been detected as a uniform
    background of weak microwave radiation.
