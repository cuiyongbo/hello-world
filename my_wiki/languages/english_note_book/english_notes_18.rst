#. Undercover angent vs Plainclothes
   
    To go "undercover" is to avoid detection by the entity one is observing,
    and especially to disguise one's own identity or use an assumed identity [化名，伪装]
    for the purposes of gaining the trust of an individual or organization to learn or
    confirm confidential information or to gain the trust of targeted individuals in 
    order to gather information or evidence.

    Undercover agents should not be confused with law enforcement officers who wear plainclothes.
    This method is used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. To wear plainclothes is to
    wear civilian clothes, instead of wearing a uniform, to avoid detection or identification as
    a law enforcement officer. However, plainclothes police officers typically carry normal police
    equipment and normal identification. **Police officers in plainclothes must identify themselves
    when using their police powers;** however, they are not required to identify themselves on demand 
    and may lie about their status as a police officer in some situations.

    usually in the absence or in spite of concrete evidence. Adapted from the saying, "If it looks 
    like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it's probably a duck." for example, 
    You aren't sure whether he likes you? Just use the duck test—if he's showing you all the signs of 
    being interested, then he most likely is.
