   Monet still makes an impression
   
   Was there frost in your neighborhood this morning? More than 100 years ago, 
   impressionist painter **Claude Monet** painted this wintry scene, called **The Frost,** 
   in the French commune of Vétheuil, where he lived from 1878 to 1881. We’re showing 
   it today in honor of his birthday. Monet is considered a father of **impressionism,** 
   the artistic movement characterized by thin brushstrokes and depicting the visual 
   impression of the moment–especially in terms of light and color. The term impressionism 
   derives from a review of Monet’s painting ‘Impression, Sunrise,’ which he exhibited in 1874. 
   Happy birthday, Claude!
