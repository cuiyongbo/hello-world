#. Hypnosis

   The induction of a state of consciousness in which a person apparently loses the power of voluntary action
   and is highly responsive to suggestion or direction. Its use in therapy, typically to recover suppressed
   memories or to allow modification of behavior by suggestion, has been revived but is still controversial.
