Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as runaway leaders Barcelona equalled the La Liga record
of 38 games unbeaten with victory over Leganes.

Barcelona v Chelsea: Lionel Messi joins the Champions League 100 club.[百球俱乐部]

Some of Messi's close control and dribbling was breathtaking, drawing gasps of delight from the home crowd,
and with three goals and that wondrous assist over the course of the two legs of the Chelsea tie it's very easy
to conclude he was the difference between the teams.

Messi is an arch-competitor and is gunning for his fifth league title after seeing bitter rivals Real Madrid take
the crown for the past two seasons.

Though Messi will rightly claim the lion's share of the headlines, perhaps the most significant moment in the game
from the home team's perspective was Dembele's thumping finish from Messi's assist - his first goal in Barca colors.

His selection in the starting XI was a surprise after he was left on the bench for the first leg, but the flamboyant
manner in which he took his goal, firing a fierce rising drive into the root of the net, showed exactly how important he could 
become to the team.

Germany and Spain played out an entertaining friendly draw in a meeting
of the past two world champions.

Spain, the 2010 World Cup winners, led within six minutes as Rodrigo
smashed home from Andres Iniesta's pass.

But reigning world champions Germany levelled from Thomas Muller's
25-yard curling effort in a lively first half.

Elsewhere, France threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 to Colombia at
the Stade de France. [法兰西大球场]

Barcelona completed one of the greatest comebacks in football history
as Paris Saint-Germain choked an incredible night at Camp Nou . [诺坎普]


Rakitic was almost impeccable on Wednesday. He completed 74 passes, more than any other player, at a conversion rate of 94.6%, 
with his controlled and sensible passing keepping his team ticking over in the way Busquets has done for so many years.

Luis Suarez's header set Barca on their way before Philippe Coutinho's sublime backheel doubled the lead. [脚后跟妙传]

Real became the first team to successfully defend the Champions League last season. [卫冕成功] 

Sevilla reached their second Copa del Rey final in three seasons with a 3-1 aggregate win over La Liga rivals Leganes.

Spurs showed maturity as well as excellence to come from two goals down to earn a draw in Turin in the first leg, 
putting themselves in a favourable position to finish the job and secure a place in the quarter-finals.

And yet from a position of strength bolstered even further
by Son's goal just before the interval [中场休息], Spurs once again came up short.

There is no doubting the quality in this Tottenham side
and they were excellent in spells at Wembley, but with two
Premier League title  campaigns promising much but unable to deliver
and an FA Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea last season, the requirement
for tangible success is intensifying.

English players may be “masters” of diving. [假摔]

Dybala is a phenomenon … sometimes. [现象级球员]

Son was inches off target late on as Spurs pressed - his performance
mirroring that of his team on a night when they got plenty right
but could not make the crucial moment count.

Pochettino is a dreamer, but this turned into a nightmare.
They've been put out by a side who were cuter, more street-wise,
and took their chance.
