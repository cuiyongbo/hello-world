====================

| Rat’s nest
| Definition: A situation or condition that is characterized by messiness, disorder, disarray, or confusion. Commonly used in the technology sector to refer to a software design or implementation that is hopelessly convoluted and difficult to understand, analogous to how a rat might construct its nest (haphazardly and hastily thrown together from whatever materials happended to be readily available at the time).
| Usage: I tried to figure out which wire was causing the problem, but there’s a veritable rat’s nest of wires, chords, and cables down there.
