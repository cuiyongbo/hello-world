#. Predication
   
   In computer science, predication is an architectural feature that 
   provides an alternative to conditional branch instructions. Predication 
   works by executing instructions from both paths of the branch and only 
   permitting those instructions from the taken path to modify architectural state. 
   The instructions from the taken path are permitted to modify architectural state b
   ecause they have been associated (predicated) with a predicate, a Boolean value 
   used by the instruction to control whether the instruction is allowed to modify 
   the architectural state or not.

#. Co-Processor

   A co-processor is a computer processor used to supplement the functions
   of CPU. Operations performed by the co-processor may be floating point arithmetic, 
   graphics, signal processing, string processing, encryption or I/O Interfacing with 
   peripheral devices. By offloading processor-intensive tasks from CPU, co-processors 
   can accelerate system performance. Co-processors allow a line of computers to be 
   customized, so that customers who do not need the extra performance don't need to 
   pay for it.

#. Overclocking [超频]

   Overclocking is the process making a computer component run at a higher speed 
   than that specified by the manufacturer. The components that can be overclocked 
   include CPU, memory and video cards.
