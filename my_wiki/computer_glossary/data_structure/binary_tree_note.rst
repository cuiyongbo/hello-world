According to wikipedia, A full binary tree (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree) is a tree 
in which every node other than the leaves has two children. A complete binary tree is a binary 
tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as 
far left as possible.
