#. Matroska
   
   The Matroska Multimedia Container is an open standard, free container format, 
   a file format that can hold an unlimited number of video, audio, picture, 
   or subtitle tracks in one file. It is a universal format for storing common 
   multimedia content, like movies or TV shows. Matroska is similar in concept 
   to other containers like AVI, MP4, but is entirely open in specification, 
   with implementations consisting mostly of open source software.

#. Brute force 
   
   Brute force (a.k.a. brute force cracking) is a trial and error method 
   used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords 
   or :abbr:`DES (Data Encryption Standard)` keys, through exhaustive effort 
   rather than employing intellectual strategies.
