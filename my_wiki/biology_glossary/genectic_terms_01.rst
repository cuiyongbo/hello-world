#. Transcription

    Transcription is the first step of gene expression, in which a particular segment of DNA is copied into RNA (especially mRNA) 
    by the enzyme RNA polymerase. Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary language. 
    During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand called 
    a primary transcript.
