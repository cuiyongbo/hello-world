#. taxonomy

   Taxonomy is the science of defining groups of biological organisms
   on the basis of shared characteristics and giving names to those groups.
   Organisms are grouped together into taxa (singular: taxon) and these groups
   are given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated
   to form a super group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy.

      Dendrogram: a tree diagram, especially one showing taxonomic relationships.

#. Biosimilar

   Biosimilars also known as follow-on biologics are biologic medical products
   whose active drug substance is made by a living organism or derived from
   a living organism by means of recombinant DNA or controlled gene expression
   methods.
