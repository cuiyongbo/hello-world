   Sequoia [红杉树]
   
   Sequoia National Park was founded on this day in 1890, and while the park’s 128 years is nothing to sneeze at, 
   some trees in the giant sequoia grove had called this home for thousands of years before they were given the 
   protection of a national park. The Giant Forest in Sequoia National Park is where **General Sherman,** the largest 
   tree in the world, stands. It is estimated to be 2,300 to 2,700 years old—a silent witness to both natural and human 
   history. By the time Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa ‘found’ the Pacific Ocean in 1513, General Sherman had 
   been growing for more than 1,500 years.

   Given recent weather events in Texas, however,

   to say for sure.

#. taxonomy
   
   Taxonomy is the science of defining groups of biological organisms 
   on the basis of shared characteristics and giving names to those groups. 
   Organisms are grouped together into taxa (singular: taxon) and these groups 
   are given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated 
   to form a super group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy.

#. Biosimilar 
   
   Biosimilars also known as follow-on biologics are biologic medical products 
   whose active drug substance is made by a living organism or derived from 
   a living organism by means of recombinant DNA or controlled gene expression 
   methods.
