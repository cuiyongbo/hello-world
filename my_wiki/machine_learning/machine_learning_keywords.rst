Regression: In this type of task, the computer program is asked to predict a
numerical value given some input. To solve this task, the learning algorithm
is asked to output a function :math:`f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`.

Vectors: A vector is an array of numbers. The numbers are arranged in
order. We can identify each individual number by its index in that ordering.
Typically we give vectors lower case names written in bold typeface, such
as :math:`\mathbf{x}`. 

Matries: A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers, so each element is identified
by two indices instead of just one. We usually give matrices upper-case
variable names with bold typeface, such as :math:`\mathbf{A}`.

The transpose of the matrix can be thought of as a mirror image across the main diagonal.

Tensors: In some cases we will need an array with more than two axes.
In the general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a
variable number of axes is known as a tensor. We denote a tensor named “A”
with this typeface: :math:`\mathsf{A}`.
