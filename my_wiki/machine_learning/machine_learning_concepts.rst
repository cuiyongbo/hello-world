#. machine learning vs deep learning
   
   The widely-quoted definition of **Machine learning** by **Tom Mitchell** best explains 
   machine learning in a nutshell. Hereâ€™s what it says:

   **A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect 
   to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance 
   at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.**

   Some examples of machine learning application come as following:

      * Predicting weights based on height
      * Storm prediction System
        
   The concept of deep learning is not new. It has been around for a couple of years now. 
   But nowadays with all the hype, deep learning is getting more attention. a formal definition 
   of **Deep Learning** comes as:

   **Deep learning is a particular kind of machine learning that achieves great power 
   and flexibility by learning to represent the world as nested hierarchy of concepts, 
   with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations 
   computed in terms of less abstract ones.**

   Some examples of deep learning application include:

      * Shape detection
      * cat vs Dog
