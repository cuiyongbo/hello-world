:abbr:`LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)`: a topic modeling method.

:abbr:`HDA (Hierarchical Dirichlet Allocation)`: a method automatically determines the number of topics.

**Sparsity** means that while you may have large matrices and vectors, 
in principle, most of the values are zero (or so small that we can round 
them to zero as a good approximation). Therefore, only a few things are 
relevant at any given time.
