    Bayesian Theorem

    .. math::

        & P(A \mid B) = {\frac {P(B \mid A)\,P(A)}{P(B)}}
                 = {\frac {P(B \mid A)\,P(A)}{P(A)P(B \mid A) + P(\bar A)P(B \mid \bar A)}} \\
        & \text{where A and B are events and } { P(B)\neq 0}.
      
.. note::

    :math:`P(A \mid B)` is a conditional probability: the likelihood of event A occurring given that B is true.
